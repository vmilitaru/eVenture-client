A [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) event management and ticketing application for organising and delivering the community classes, another [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) initiative to introduce people from diverse backgrounds to the world of tech. Working in a team of five people, we took on the challenge and we identified the pain points of participants and organisers for this problem. And the solution that we came up with was a web app that allows the bootcampers/organisers to create and manage the events and forthcoming participants to sign up to an upcoming event.

-   Participants can login and sign up for an event.They also have the posibility to see the list of their upcoming events in **My Events** page, where they can also cancel their registration to a particular event .

-   Organisers can create and edit events, a functionality to which only the organisers have access based on the access permisions associated to their account in the Auth0 dashboard.

- Organisers can track the attendance to a specific event.

## Live Project

Here is the [deployed version](https://eventure.vercel.app/).

## Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
- [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)


## Getting Started


1. Make sure that you have Node.js installed and clone the repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vmilitaru/eVenture-client.git
cd into the folder
```

2. Next, install all the package dependencies to run the app

```bash
npm install
# or
npm i
```

## Configuring Auth0

3. Go to the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) and create a new application of type _Single Page Application_ and make sure to configure the following
4. Go to the settings tab of the application page
5. Configure the following settings:
   -  _Allowed Callback URLs_: Should be set to `http://localhost:3000` when testing locally or typically to `https://myapp.com` when deploying your application and any other URL to which you want the user to be redirected to after the autentication
   - _Allowed Logout URLs_: Should be set to `http://localhost:3000/` when testing locally or typically to `https://myapp.com/` when deploying your application or any other URL to which you want the user to be redirected to after logout from Auth0
   - _Allowed Web Origins_: Should be set to `http://localhost:3000/` when testing locally or typically to `https://myapp.com/` when deploying your application
   - _Allowed Origins (CORS)_: Should be set to `http://localhost:3000/` when testing locally or typically to `https://myapp.com/` when deploying your application
   - Enable _Absolute Expiration_ option
   - Enable _Inactivity Expiration_ option
6. Save the settings
7. Go to the _APIs_ page from the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) and create an API. This API is used to restriction the access the the organiser APIs
8. Go to the settings tab of the new created API page
9. Configure the following settings:
   - Enable _Enable RBAC_ option
   - Enable _Add Permissions in the Access Token_ option
   - Enable _Allow Skipping User Consent_ option
10. Save the settings
11. Stay on the new created API page but go to Permisssions tab and add a permission to the API - remember by doing this we are making sure that, based on the role assigned to their account only certain users will have access to the organiser APIs :

```bash
use:role
```
12. Go to the _Users & Roles_ page from the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/) and create a role :

```bash
Name: organiser
Description : use:org 
```
13. Now in order to assign the user role to the idToken we need to create a rule in the _Rules_ menu from the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/). Make sure that the rule that you just created is enabled.

```bash
function (user, context, callback) {
const namespace = `http://localhost:3000/`;
const assignedRoles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

let idTokenClaims = context.idToken || {};

idTokenClaims[ `${namespace}/roles` ] = assignedRoles;

context.idToken = idTokenClaims;

callback(null, user, context);
}
```

14. Now if we want to assign the **organiser role** to a particular user we just need to go on _Users & Roles >Actions > Assign To Users_ type in the email address of the organiser user and click _Assign_ - easy as that .


### Set up environment variables

To connect the app with Auth0, you'll need to add the settings from your Auth0 application as environment variables.

15. Copy the content of `.env.example` into a new file called `.env.local` at the root of this project, then add the missing environment variables:

    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_DOMAIN` - Can be found in the Auth0 dashboard under _Applications_ ,select the created Application and go to `settings`.
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` - Can be found in the Auth0 dashboard under _Applications_ ,select the created Application and go to `settings`.
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH0_AUDIENCE` - Can be found in the Auth0 dashboard under _APIs_ ,got to `settings` tab and copy the _Identifier_.
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` - Should be set to `http://localhost:5000` when testing locally (if you check the back end code of this project you will see that 5000 is the port to which the express server is currently listening to) or typically to `https://myserver.com` when deploying the  server.
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL` - Should be set to `http://localhost:3000` when testing locally or typically to `https://myapp.com` when deploying the server.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm run dev  # runs the app in the development mode
```
```bash
npm run build # create a production build.
```
```bash
npm run start # start the app in production mode.
```
## Deploy on Vercel

You can deploy this app to the cloud with [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) ([Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)).

### Deploy Your Local Project

To deploy your local project to Vercel, push it to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket and [import to Vercel](https://vercel.com/import/git?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example).

**Important**: When you import your project on Vercel, make sure to click on **Environment Variables** and set them to match your `.env.local` file.
